1. **Power BI Desktop vs Online Service:**

   * **Desktop:** report creation tool (build, model, visualize data).
   * **Online Service:** for sharing, collaboration, and cloud-based management.

2. **Publishing a Report:**

   * Click **Home → Publish** in Power BI Desktop → choose a **workspace** in the service.

3. **Workspace:**

   * A collaborative area to store and manage reports, datasets, and dashboards.
   * **Types:** *My Workspace* (personal) and *Shared/Professional Workspaces* (team-based).

4. **Workspace vs App:**

   * **Workspace:** for building and collaboration.
   * **App:** read-only packaged content shared with end users.

5. **License Types:**

   * **Free:** limited to personal use.
   * **Pro:** needed for sharing and collaboration.
   * **Premium:** for large-scale use, advanced features, and capacity-based sharing.

6. **Sharing Without Pro License:**

   * Publish to a **Premium workspace** — viewers with Free licenses can access.

7. **Semantic Model (Dataset):**

   * Central data model used by reports; stored in **Power BI Service workspace**.

8. **Scheduled Refresh:**

   * Automatically updates datasets on a set schedule (e.g., daily/hourly) in the Service.

9. **Dataset vs Dataflow:**

   * **Dataset:** ready-to-use data model for reports.
   * **Dataflow:** ETL process to prepare/reuse data across multiple datasets.

10. **Use Dataflow Instead of Dataset:**

    * When you need **centralized, reusable data transformations** for multiple reports.

11. **Dashboard:**

    * A single-page summary view with pinned visuals from reports.
    * **Reports** are multi-page and interactive; **dashboards** are not.

12. **Pin Visual to Dashboard:**

    * In a report → click the **Pin icon** → choose a dashboard destination.

13. **Mobile View:**

    * Optimized layout for phone/tablet viewing; improves accessibility and usability.

14. **Paginated Report:**

    * Pixel-perfect, print-ready reports; used for invoices or long tables.

15. **Export to PDF/PowerPoint:**

    * In Power BI Service → **File → Export → PDF/PPT**.

16. **Live Connection:**

    * Report connects directly to a published dataset or Analysis Services model (no data copy).

17. **Row-Level Security (RLS):**

    * Restricts data access per user role; defined in Desktop and enforced in Service.

18. **Testing RLS:**

    * In Service → Dataset → **Security → Test as role**.

19. **Apps:**

    * Packaged dashboards/reports from a workspace shared with users; publish via **“Publish app”** button.

20. **Enterprise Benefits:**

    * Centralized data, collaboration, security (RLS), auto-refresh, versioning, and scalability.
